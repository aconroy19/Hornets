    <h1>About The NRSA</h1>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3> The North Rockland Soccer Association (NRSA) was founded in1978 by Elvio Nardi, a local barber, and his wife Fran.
         Their sole intention was to allow the children in North Rockland to have a place to learn and play soccer.
         Since the Nardis started the NRSA, it has become one of the largest recreational programs in the area.
         The NRSA serves the North Rockland community for boys and girls of all ages.
         Along with the recreational program, there is a travel program for children who want to play on a more competitive level. </h3>
